# Applications

Exact real computation has advantages and disadvantages when compared to the usual floating-point computation, *i.e.*, the approach where each real number is encoded by a single floating-point number.  We highlight several applications where the advantages (*i.e.*, **reliability and transparent semantics**) of exact real computation outweighs its disadvantages (*i.e.*, **higher and harder to predict computation cost**).
