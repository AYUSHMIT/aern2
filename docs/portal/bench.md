# Implementation benchmarks

It is a challenge to implement exact real computation which is space and time efficient.  We have benchmarked a selection of implementations (currently only Haskell ones) on a set of real-number computation problems.  In most cases the benchmarks compare the implementations in terms of their speed and memory consumption when computing the same real number result with a range of accuracies.
