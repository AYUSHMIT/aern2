# Comparing representations of exact unary continuous real functions

_This is work in progress._

## Benchmark setup

The benchmark timings are obtained on a Dell Inspiron 15R with 8GB RAM,
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3632QM CPU @ 2.20GHz running Ubuntu 14.04.

The benchmarks have been compiled using ghc-7.8.4 with -O2.

Each benchmark has been executed repeatedly until 3 consecutive times the results have fluctuated for less than 5%.

## Benchmark results

### A well-behaved analytic function with many fluctuations

#### Integration over [-1,1]

#### Maximum over [-1,1]

### An analytic function with a small radius of convergence

#### Integration over [-1,1]

#### Maximum over [-1,1]

### A non-smooth function

#### Integration over [-1,1]

#### Maximum over [-1,1]
